In variables4 we already learned how to make an immutable variable mutable
using a special keyword. Unfortunately this doesn't help us much in this exercise
because we want to assign a different typed value to an existing variable. Sometimes
you may also like to reuse existing variable names because you are just converting
values to different types like in this exercise.
Fortunately Cairo has a powerful solution to this problem: 'Shadowing'!
You can see an example of variables and 'shadowing' here: https://link.medium.com/c8TqX7R3qxb#4fe8
You can read about the different integer types here: https://link.medium.com/c8TqX7R3qxb#6d64
If you want to learn more about this concept, you can also read about it in the Rust Book:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing
Try to solve this exercise afterwards using this technique."""

We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
variable available: constants.
Constants are always immutable and they are declared with keyword 'const' rather
than keyword 'let'.
Constants types must also always be annotated.

This is a really common error that can be fixed by removing one character.
It happens because Cairo distinguishes between expressions and statements: expressions return a value based on their operand(s), and statements simply return a () type which behaves just like `void` in C/C++ language.
We want to return a value of `felt` type from the `square` function, but it is returning a `()` type...
They are not the same. There are two solutions:
1. Add a `return` ahead of `num * num;`
2. remove `;`, make it to be `num * num`"""

# STRUCTS

Cairo has a single type of struct that are named collections of related data stored in fields.
In this exercise you need to complete and implement a struct.
Here is how we describe a person struct that stores a name and an age,

#[derive(Copy, Drop)]
struct Person {
    name: felt,
    age: felt,
}

You'd use the struct like so,

let john = Person { name: 'John', age: 29 };

Creating instances of structs is easy, all you need to do is assign some values to its fields. Unlike Rust, Cairo requires you to initialize all fields when creating a struct and
there is no update syntax available at the moment. You can have multiple data types in a struct, and even other structs.

There are some shortcuts that can be taken when destructuring structs by using the following syntax: `let Foo {x: a, y: b} = foo`;

For is_international: What makes a package international? Seems related to the places it goes through right?

For get_fees: This method takes an additional argument, is there a field in the Package struct that this relates to?
