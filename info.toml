In variables4 we already learned how to make an immutable variable mutable

you may also like to reuse existing variable names because you are just converting
values to different types like in this exercise.
Fortunately Cairo has a powerful solution to this problem: 'Shadowing'!
You can see an example of variables and 'shadowing' here: https://link.medium.com/c8TqX7R3qxb#4fe8

This is a really common error that can be fixed by removing one character.
It happens because Cairo distinguishes between expressions and statements: expressions return a value based on their operand(s), and statements simply return a () type which behaves just like `void` in C/C++ language.
We want to return a value of `felt` type from the `square` function, but it is returning a `()` type...

1. Add a `return` ahead of `num * num;`
